# About
- A game of battleship [Read More Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game))
- Currently only play against a basic AI


# Eventually (maybe)
- Rotate the ship to allow vertical placement
- Take more advantage of TDD
- Better AI 
- Make player 2 and switch boards with each turn
- Code Refactor
